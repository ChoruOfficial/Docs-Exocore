## 🔧 Step 2: Locate the `config.json` File

Once you've cloned the project, look for the `config.json` file inside the project directory. This file contains important configuration settings such as the default username and password.

Here’s the default content:

```json
{
  "user": "RootAdminChoru",
  "pass": "Stevepen4321!"
}

```

✨ Step 3: Update Your Credentials

For security purposes, it's strongly recommended that you change the default username and password to your own values:
```json
{
  "user": "YourCustomUsername",
  "pass": "YourStrongPassword123"
}
```
> ⚠️ Make sure to use a secure and unique password to prevent unauthorized access.

✅ You're Ready!

Once you've updated the credentials, you're ready to run and explore the project. If you encounter issues or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or pull request on the original repository.

Happy coding! 💻✨
